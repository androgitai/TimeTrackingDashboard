## My process

- First I layed out the HTML and worked out class names and general file structure. After that I refactored a couple of times to make it more concise.
- Added the JS functionality and where needed I did a bit more refactor in all the code to make ther JS part easier.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a lot about positioning and what makes it a lot easier to do it. Once I got the hang of the main concepts with some tries & fails eventually it worked. 
Sass makes it very easy to structure you code.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is an amazing website which helped me understand a lot about CSS & Javascript.
